%               This script was changed from calculating log-pressure
%               vertical velocity (w = Dz/Dt, units = 1/s) to computing
%               a pressure vertical velocity at the pressure level of
%               maximum vertical structure, pM.
%               omegaM has units of mb/day.
%               MM - August 26 2006 - Writes to matFiles vs. output
%               MM - August 06 2008 - removed call to internal matlab
%                    'pack'.  In current versions of matlab, pack can
%                    only be called from the command line.

% CALL SYNTAX:  omegaMBalanced;
%
% PRE: The following scripts have been been called:
%               MJO_MASTER.m
%               BALANCED_CALL.m
%               balancedBasis.m
%
% POST: A matlab format output file is written to 
%       the directory "matFiles" found in the parent directory
%       "models". The file name is field_b_omegaM.mat and contains
%       the variable b_omegaM = b_omegaM(yHat,xi). Also has the vertical
%       structure applied to it.
%

% Start statement
disp('omegaMBalanced.m script      : [b_omegaM(yHat,xi)] - physical space balanced vertical pressure velocity (b_omegaM)')

% Get spectral space log-pressure vertical velocity
wmn = bSpectralw(psimn,Qmn,alfa,c,mMax,nMax);

% Hermite expand w
wH = bHermite(wmn,H0,Hn,yHatVec,mMax,nMax);

% Inverse fourier transform the Hermite expanded, balanced w
bwF = bIFourier(wH,yHatVec,xiVec,mMax);

% Get vertical velocity in pressure units (hPa/day), at the
% pressure level of maximum vertical structure magnitude, pM.
% b_omegaF = -p*bwF, so b_omegaMF = -pM*bwF.
b_omegaMF = -pM*86400*bwF;

% Want to plot at vertical structure max: Z'(pM) = 1.
ZprimeMax = structureZprime(pM);

% Get total balanced omegaM field b_omegaM(yHat,xi,z)
b_omegaM = ZprimeMax*b_omegaMF;

% % save b_omegaM field
% disp('  Saving b_omegaM(yHat,xi)   : [b_omegaM] -> matFiles/field_b_omegaM.mat')
% save ./matFiles/field_b_omegaM.mat b_omegaM
